** KiCad library
*** Part Information:
   - Pulled from server information, auto-populated as much as possible
   - Rules for what values are visible in schem for different components
   - When importing Official KiCad parts, only need to rename to IPN
*** Schematic Symbol:
    - IPN (name),
    - Description,
    - Value (visible in schem),
    - Key specs (visible in schem),
    - URL (to server)
*** Library Repo:
   - *.seeds* directory
     - resistor seed symbol
     - capacitor seed symbol
     - polarized cap seed symbol
     - ferrite bead seed symbol
     - etc...
   - manual directory (what can't be procedurally generated)
     - Opamp
   - generated directory (ignored by git)
     - RES0402
     - RES0603
     - ...
     - CAP0402
   - scripts directory
